## pfx2john

**pfx2john** is a python2 script to excract password hash of a .pfx file.

```bash
python2 /usr/share/john/pfx2john.py file.pfx > pfx.john
```

{% hint style="info" %}
For people that use **Python3**, that we remove `b'` and `'` from the output of the Python script to ensure that John properly reads the hash.
{% endhint %}

Ready to crack it with JrR

```bash
john pfx.john -wordlist:/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

## keepass2john

Convert your KeePass databases (.kdbx) to John the Ripper's format effortlessly using this conversion tool.

```bash
keepass2jogn file.kdbx
```

If the file is saved with Keepass version â‰¥ 2.36, the tool above won't work. Use this script to extract the hash.
