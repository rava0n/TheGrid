### Use Burpsuite always

Utilize `Burpsuite` to the fullest, it helps you so much on this section when finding for majority of the vulnerabilities that could be hidden on this web app.



### Authorize burp extention

Utilize [Authorize](https://medium.com/@Kuber19/burp-extension-1-autorize-93584a179b85) burp extension to find for broken access control or IDOR, this one recommended by my friend and it changed my life.



### How get the flags

There is **no ‚Äúflag.txt‚Äù** to capture, if you exploited the ‚Äúvalid‚Äù vulnerability they designed for and in the ‚Äúvalid‚Äù way then the flag will be displayed right away.



### SQLMap

Suspect this function is communicating with database? capture it and run sqlmap in the background while you are testing for other vulnerability and come back to it from time to time, you might find something interesting.



### Make user to admin

Probably we have to upgrade the settings for a user to admin. Or create a new user with the Administrator field.
