# LitterBox

> LitterBox provides a controlled sandbox environment designed for security professionals to develop and test payloads. This platform allows red teams to:
>
> * Test evasion techniques against modern detection techniques
> * Validate detection signatures before field deployment
> * Analyze malware behavior in an isolated environment
> * Keep payloads in-house without exposing them to external security vendors
> * Ensure payload functionality without triggering production security controls
>
> The platform includes LLM-assisted analysis capabilities through the LitterBoxMCP server, offering advanced analytical insights using natural language processing technology.
