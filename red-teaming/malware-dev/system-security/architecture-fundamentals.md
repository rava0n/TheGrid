# Architecture Fundamentals

## CPU Architecture

A CPU (Central Processing Unit) is often referred to as the brain of computerm responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations.\
The CPU is the device in change of **executing the machine code of a program**.

As a rule, each CPU has its own **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**.

**CPU instructions** are represented in **hexadecimal (HEX) format**. Due the inherent unreadable nature and complexity, it is impossible for humand to read or utilize it in its natural format.

As a result, machine code is translated into Assembly Language (ASM). Its mnemonic code (a more readable language) that humans can understand and interpret. Assembly Language is a low-level programming language that is closely related to the machine code instructions of a specific CPU arch.

Different CPU architectures have their own instruction sets and assembly languages. For example, **x86 assembly language** is used for Intel and AMD processors, while **ARM assembly language** is used for ARM-based processors.

### Control Unit (CU)

The Control Unit is responsible for coordinating and controlling the operations of the CPU.

It fetches instructions from memory, decodes them, and manages the execution of instructions by directing data movement and control flow within the CPU.

### Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

The Arithmetic Logic Unit is the component responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations.

It can perform basic operations like addition, sebtraction, multiplication, division, as well as logical operations like AND, OR, and NOT.

### Registers

Registers are small, high-speed storage locations within the CPU used to store data temporarily during processing.



## CPU Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

Each CPU has its own **instruction set architecture (ISA)**. The ISA is the set of instructions that a programmer (or a compiler) must understand and use to write a program correctly for that specific CPU and machine.

The most common ISA is the **x86 instruction** set (or arch) which originated from the Intel 8086 processor.&#x20;

The **x86 acronym** identifies 32-bit processors, **while x64** (aka x86\_64 or AMD64) identifies the 64-bit versions.
