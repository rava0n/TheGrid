### PowerShell-Obfuscation-Bible

> A collection of techniques, examples and a little bit of theory for manually obfuscating PowerShell scripts to bypass signature-based detection, compiled for educational purposes. The contents of this repository are the result of personal research, including reading materials online and conducting trial-and-error attempts in labs and pentests. You should not take anything for granted.
