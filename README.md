Hey there!&#x20;

I’m a 20-year-old Cybersecurity Specialist with a strong passion for offensive security and continuous learning. I currently hold the **eJPTv2** certification and am actively working toward earning the **eCPPTv3** and **CRTAv2** to deepen my skills in penetration testing and red teaming.

Outside of work, I regularly train on **Hack The Box**, sharpening my skills as a CTF player. I use these challenges not just for fun, but as a key part of my preparation to become a **Red Teamer,** learning to think like an adversary, understand attack chains, and simulate real-world threat scenarios.

**The Grid** is where i document my journey: techniques, tools, labs, and lessons learned.&#x20;

Enjoy! 🌐
