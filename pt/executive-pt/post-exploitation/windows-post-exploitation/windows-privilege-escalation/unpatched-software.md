# Unpatched Software

Software installed on the target system can present various privilege escalation opportunities. As with drivers, organisations and users may not update them as often as they update the operating system.

## Get system on the target

```powershell
wmic product get name,version,vendor
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The `wmic product` command might not list all installed programs. Some programs could be missing due to the way they were installed. Check desktop shortcuts, services, or other signs of software presence to ensure nothing vulnerable is overlooked.
