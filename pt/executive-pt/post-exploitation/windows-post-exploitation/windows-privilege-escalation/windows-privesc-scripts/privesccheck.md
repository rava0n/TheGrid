# PrivescCheck

PrivescCheck is a PowerShell script that searches common privilege escalation on the target system. It provides an alternative to WinPEAS without requiring the execution of a binary file.

> _This script aims to identify **Local Privilege Escalation** (LPE) vulnerabilities that are usually due to Windows configuration issues, or bad practices. It can also gather useful information for some exploitation and post-exploitation tasks._
